/**
 * A time with an offset from UTC/Greenwich in the ISO-8601 calendar system,

 * <p>
 * {@code OffsetTime} is an immutable date-time object that represents a time, often
 * viewed as hour-minute-second-offset.
 * This class stores all time fields, to a precision of nanoseconds,
 * as well as a zone offset.
 * For example, the value "13:45:30.123456789+02:00" can be stored
 * in an {@code OffsetTime}.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is a <a href="{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>
 * class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality
 * ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of
 * {@code OffsetTime} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
 * The {@code equals} method should be used for comparisons.

 * @implSpec
