/**
 * A clock providing access to the current instant, date and time using a time-zone.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class are used to find the current instant, which can be
 * interpreted using the stored time-zone to find the current date and time.
 * As such, a clock can be used instead of {@link System#currentTimeMillis()}
 * and {@link TimeZone#getDefault()}.
 * <p>
 * Use of a {@code Clock} is optional. All key date-time classes also have a
 * {@code now()} factory method that uses the system clock in the default time zone.
 * The primary purpose of this abstraction is to allow alternate clocks to be
 * plugged in as and when required. Applications use an object to obtain the
 * current time rather than a static method. This can simplify testing.
 * <p>
 * Best practice for applications is to pass a {@code Clock} into any method
 * that requires the current instant. A dependency injection framework is one
 * way to achieve this:
 * <pre>
 *  public class MyBean {
 *    private Clock clock;  // dependency inject
 *    ...
 *    public void process(LocalDate eventDate) {
 *      if (eventDate.isBefore(LocalDate.now(clock)) {
 *        ...
 *      }
 *    }
 *  }
 * </pre>
 * This approach allows an alternate clock, such as {@link #fixed(Instant, ZoneId) fixed}
 * or {@link #offset(DesugarClock, Duration) offset} to be used during testing.
 * <p>
 * The {@code system} factory methods provide clocks based on the best available
 * system clock This may use {@link System#currentTimeMillis()}, or a higher
 * resolution clock if one is available.
 *
 * @implSpec
 * This abstract class must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
 * All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * The principal methods are defined to allow the throwing of an exception.
 * In normal use, no exceptions will be thrown, however one possible implementation would be to
 * obtain the time from a central time server across the network. Obviously, in this case the
 * lookup could fail, and so the method is permitted to throw an exception.
 * <p>
 * The returned instants from {@code Clock} work on a time-scale that ignores leap seconds,
 * as described in {@link Instant}. If the implementation wraps a source that provides leap
 * second information, then a mechanism should be used to "smooth" the leap second.
 * The Java Time-Scale mandates the use of UTC-SLS, however clock implementations may choose
 * how accurate they are with the time-scale so long as they document how they work.
 * Implementations are therefore not required to actually perform the UTC-SLS slew or to
 * otherwise be aware of leap seconds.
 * <p>
 * Implementations should implement {@code Serializable} wherever possible and must
 * document whether or not they do support serialization.
 *
 * @implNote
 * The clock implementation provided here is based on the same underlying clock
 * as {@link System#currentTimeMillis()}, but may have a precision finer than
 * milliseconds if available.
 * However, little to no guarantee is provided about the accuracy of the
 * underlying clock. Applications requiring a more accurate clock must implement
 * this abstract class themselves using a different external clock, such as an
 * NTP server.
 *
 * @since 1.8
